# Project_MaskDetection <br>
* Development of mask wearing detection model using CNN <br>

* For GSA infomatics science project. <br>

**Feature**

1. Using CNN artificial neural network for model training. <br>
2. When the file is executed, the location of the face is automatically determined<br>
to determine whether the mask is worn or not.

**How to use?**

1. execute main.py <br>
(You can find it on ./detector/main.py) 
2. after you got the result, press 'q' to exit. <br>

**Referance**
I used yunet detector to find faces. <br>
